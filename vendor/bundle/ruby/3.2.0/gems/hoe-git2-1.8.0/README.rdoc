== Description

A set of Hoe plugins for tighter Git integration. Provides tasks to automate release tagging and pushing and changelog
generation. I expect it'll learn a few more tricks in the future.

This is an evolution of +hoe-git+ by John Barnette, which has been archived at <http://github.com/jbarnette/hoe-git>.

== Examples

    # in your Rakefile
    Hoe.plugin :git2

If this plugin cannot see that it is in a `.git` directory, it'll silently deactivate itself.

=== Autogenerating the Changelog

    $ rake git:changelog

This takes all the commit messages since your last release and formats
'em into a nice RDoc fragment. If you specify <tt>VERSION</tt>, it'll
be used in the changelog fragment. If you specify <tt>FROM</tt>, it'll
be used as a starting point for the changelog instead of your last
tagged release.

The rdoc is automatically formatted into sections by using "annotated
commit messages" by using a simple format for multi-line commit messages:

    ! major change description.
    + minor change description.
    - bug fix description.
    un-logged description (for minor stuff like re-formatting).

=== Generating the Manifest

    $ rake git:manifest

This will regenerate <tt>Manifest.txt</tt> using <tt>git
ls-files</tt>. It respects Hoe's manifest sort order and excludes.

=== Tagging and Sanity Checking a Release

    $ rake release VERSION=1.0.0

In addition to the normal RubyForge release process, this will create
and push a <tt>v1.0.0</tt> tag. It'll also abort the release if your
index is dirty, or if there are untracked files present.

=== git-svn

The <tt>git:changelog</tt> and <tt>git:tag</tt> tasks understand
<tt>git-svn</tt> repositories, and will adjust their behavior
accordingly.

== Dependencies

Hoe and Git, obviously. I wouldn't be surprised if things don't quite
work for git < 2.37.

== Installation

    $ gem install hoe-git2

== TODO

* Release tags are sorted lexicographically right now, which won't
  work for long.
