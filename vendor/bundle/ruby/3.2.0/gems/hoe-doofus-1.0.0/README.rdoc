= Hoe is a Doofus

* http://github.com/jbarnette/hoe-doofus

== Description

A Hoe plugin that helps me (and you, maybe?) keep from messing up gem
releases. It shows a configurable checklist when <tt>rake release</tt>
is run, and provides a chance to abort if anything's been forgotten.

== Examples

    # in your Rakefile
    Hoe.plugin :doofus

    # to see the current checklist
    $ rake doofus

== Installation

    $ gem install hoe-doofus
