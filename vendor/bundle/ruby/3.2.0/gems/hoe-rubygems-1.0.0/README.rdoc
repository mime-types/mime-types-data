= Hoe Loves RubyGems

* http://github.com/jbarnette/hoe-rubygems

== Description

A Hoe plugin with additional RubyGems tasks. Provides support for
generating gemspec files and installing with a prefix.

== Examples

  # in your Rakefile
  Hoe.plugin :rubygems

=== Generating a Gemspec

    $ rake gem:spec

This will write <tt>projectname.gemspec</tt> into the root directory
of your project.

=== Installing with a Prefix

Developing with prefixed forks of gems can be really hard, since,
e.g., a GitHub gem that installs as <tt>jbarnette-johnson</tt> via
GitHub's source will install as <tt>johnson</tt> from a local
checkout. To install with a prefix, try:

    $ rake gem:install[jbarnette]

For Johnson, this would locally install a gem called
<tt>jbarnette-johnson</tt>.

<tt>gem:install</tt> without a prefix argument will do exactly the
same thing as Hoe's built-in <tt>install_gem</tt> task.

== Installation

    $ gem install hoe-rubygems
